	Often times when looking for ways to make money, people will go to Google and search, "how to make money fast" or "best way to make money quick." Nobody seems to understand that money is an asset that will almost always come becuase of <b>effort and skill.</b> Those who are willing to put the time and effort it takes into learning a valuable skill will acquire currency, but the vast majority of those who do not will have to settle with mediocre lives, and a burning question will always be torturing them:

	"What if I had Googled something useful that day?"

<p style="color:orange;font-family:verdana;text-align:left;font-size:120%;padding: 0 250px">
	When you see a child selling lemonade for dirt-cheap prices on the side of the road, what is your first thought? Do you think, "Oh, that poor kid is putting so much effort into getting such a small amount of money," or do you think, "Now that's a kid who is going to grow into a strong money maker?" Maybe you thing both, or maybe you think neither. Maybe you go up to him and buy a glass, or maybe you cruise past, wondering if he will be succesfull at all in his venture.
</p><br>

<p style="color:orange;font-family:verdana;text-align:left;font-size:120%;padding: 0 250px">
	Whatever you do, that child will learn from the experience. If you buy a glass from him, he might see that his idea is working-- and soon he'll have enough for that cool bike he's saving for. Or if you cruise past, staring, he'll wonder why you didn't stop... And perhaps will brainstorm ways of getting you to stop at his homemade kiosk. 
</p><br>

<p style="color:orange;font-family:verdana;text-align:left;font-size:120%;padding: 0 250px">
	Let's say the next day you return to location, and the child has set up shop once again- except this time, he has returned with a new business idea: Sell cookies with the lemonade! Suddenly people are stopping regularly, and that kid has to go home to make more lemonade and cookies. 
</p><br>


<p style="color:orange;font-family:verdana;text-align:left;font-size:120%;padding: 0 250px">
	That little dude learned a valuable lesson, even if it was an easy one to learn: Without perseverance, he wouldn't have a shoebox full of cash and change to count. And because of that perserverance, he's $11.75 closer to that shiny new bike.
</p><br>

<p style="color:orange;font-family:verdana;text-align:left;font-size:120%;padding: 0 250px">
	That kid is no different than you and I. As adults, we need more money than what we can likely make at a single lemonade stand at the side of the road, so we are forced to persue more elaborate ways of doing it. However, the concept is the same: Do something worthy of being paid. Sure, hit Google and looks for ways to make money. But try this: instead of searching "Best way to make money fast," instead, search "Highest paying job of [insert current year." Pick an interesting line of work from what you found, and start searching, "How to get started as a(n) [insert job here.]"
</p><br>

<h2 style="color:orange;font-family:verdana;text-align:left;font-size:120%;padding: 0 250px">
	So whatever you choose to do, make sure you do it with dedication and perserverance, and like the kid with the lemonade stand, you too will be succesful... But maybe not the very next day.
